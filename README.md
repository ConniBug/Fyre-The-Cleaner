## Fyre The Cleaner

This is a discord bot designed for LGBT/Trans servers with a database full of the bans from larger LGBT/Trans servers

all the bans in our database are from larger trusted/responsible servers or from Pridefall leaks

When someone joins the server you can use the command *inspect <userID/tag> example 299709641271672832 or "Conni!~#0920" this will display information about that users ban if they are banned else it will tell you they are not known to the db

*checkall will check all existing users to see if they are known as being bad people

You can add to our database by contacting me on discord and proving you can be trusted Conni!~#0920
